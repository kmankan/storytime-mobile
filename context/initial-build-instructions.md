I want to build a simple web app that does the following:

- has a title "find a story..."
- allows the user to enter a sentence in an input box e.g. "something funny and light hearted"
- it uses the project gutenberg api to find an appropriate book
- see the included instructions for how to use the gutenberg api gutendex. where possible we should try NOT to host it locally and use calls to gutendex.
